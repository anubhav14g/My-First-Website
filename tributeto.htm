<p><font color=aqua size=6>I was 17 years old when I read Stephen Hawkings book "A Brief History of Time".
His book ignighted a drive in me to learn more about our universe. That drive is still alive in me to this day. 
I have selected several key points in his life for this tribute page.

<p><font color=lime size=6>"Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.
Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist.
Be curious. And however difficult life may seem there is always something you can do and succeed at.
It matters that you don't just give up."</p></font>
